ctime is a deprecated header in C++. So using it gave error in compilation on visual studio 2022 - "it is not safe, use ctime_s instead", but using that too gave error.


One solution is to write this line in your program "#pragma warning(disable : 4996)"

Another solution (which I used) was to go to project -> basic output and date properties -> General -> SDL checks -> disable SDL checks (originally on)

No more errors. Program compiles successfully.
